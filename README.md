### And the Oscar goes to...

**Hypothesis:** Oscar winners can be determined based upon other award show wins. (How many other wins?)

Using historical data from several other well-known film awards, I will create classification models to see if the Oscar winners can be determined based upon previous awards. 
The categories I will look at are:
- Best Film
- Best Actor/Actress
- Supporting Actor/Actress

#### Acquire
Use Kaggle datasets to analyse:
- Academy Awards
- British Academy Film Awards
- Golden Globes
- Screen Actors Guild Award

#### Prepare
- Normalize data
- Drop unnecessary columns
- Combine award show data sets

#### Explore
- Look for correlation between award winners and different award shows
- Is there a certain number of awards that must be won that will indicate an Oscar win?

#### Model 
- Classification model
